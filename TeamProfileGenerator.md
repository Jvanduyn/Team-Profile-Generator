  ## Description
  
  This project was a test of my use of Node, Javascript, and Object Oriented Programming. I wanted to create this project to be able to show that I would be able to use test driven development, as well as be able to use multiple classes and subclasses to sort through data. From there I am using multiple functions that are using template literals to create a page with multiple cards.During this project, the user will need to input information regarding their team. There will be 3 types of team members and different questions it asks you based off which type of team member. This will collect all of the data to be pushed into an HTML file. The user can input as many Engineers, and Interns as they would like as there is no limit.
